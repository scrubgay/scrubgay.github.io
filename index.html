<p>My name is Renz (they/them) - this is my portfolio website! I'm a queer Filipino currently based in Gainesville studying GIS and urban planning. I work with <a href="https://gnvfgs.org">Free Grocery Store</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/farm2n">Farm 2 Neighbors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>Although I was born in New York City, my home landscape is the war between the xeric scrub of the Lake Wales Ridge (of unknown Native territoriality) and the stroads, sprawl, and single-family housing of Central Floridian suburbia. Here I saw the decimation of exceedingly endemic plant populations and habitats for scrub jays and gopher tortoises, for a capitalist urbanization that gave zero fucks about the people it houses or the land it destroys.</p>
<p>Now living in Gainesville, FL, I find beauty in the diverse landscapes - springs, bluffs, sandhills, savannas, salt marshes - of North Florida. I enjoy what I can of Florida's most left-leaning city while being unafraid to want so much better than what it produces.</p>
<h2 id="my-urban-philosophy">My urban philosophy</h2>
<p>My approach to urbanity is not motivated by the form of cities, but of the preservation of processes and of ecology (sensu lato). Cities at a minimum must have their forms designed for the scale of human mobilities, and they must be tightly bound to prevent encroachment onto the little natural/managed lands that are left. However, a walkable/smart growth/New Urbanist/[<em>buzzword</em>] city means nothing if it excludes or limits Black, Indigenous, Brown, or disabled autonomy. The best City is the one where residents are not reduced to a biopolitical subject managed by Capital. This can look like</p>
<ul>
<li>a housing means of production owned by the people it houses</li>
<li>a local food system owned by the people that grow and the people that eat</li>
<li>neighborhoods and transportation networks designed for human, not car, scales of mobility, designed for any mobility</li>
</ul>
<p>The best City is the one where Capital does not live and does not accumulate in the hands of few.</p>
<p>I want the language and tools of endless extraction dead. I want autonomy of process for their communities. The local forms of these worlds, on principle, will differ community to community - just so long as the processes enabling capitalism and colonization are ended.</p>
