<p>My name is Renz - welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a queer Filipino currently based in Gainesville, FL. I am a director of <a href="https://gnvfgs.org">Free Grocery Store</a>, a local food pantry. I am a graduate student of urban and regional planning with a focus on transportation planning at the University of Florida. I like walking and biking a <em>lot</em>, and also ecology and data analysis.</p>

<h2 id="my-geography">My geography</h2>
<p>I call the Lake Wales Ridge home. I most know it as the warzone between the scrub - a plant community made of rare mints, leathery-leaved oaks, and fragrant thorny shrubs - and the encroachment of placeless suburbia. My hometown was originally just a rural regional center with an oddly high concentration of Filipinos and elders amidst scrub and agriculture. It's currently going the way of most of inland Central Florida, a sprawl fueled by land speculation eating away indiscriminately at highly endemic ecologies and failed citrus groves both. I get a lot of my emotional inspiration for my ideology on psychogeography from the Lake Wales Ridge.</p>
<p>I left Florida in 2015 after a bit of acute emotional trauma for college. After a brief stint in Northeastern Ohio and more broadly the Great Lakes, I settled in the Puget Sound, bopping from Tacoma to Seattle. While formally studying ecology at the University of Washington, I explored the notion of place and narrative building through geography. On several scales I observed and participated in many geographies, racial and class displacement in and out of Seattle, the dxʷdəwʔabš (Duwamish) fight for land and recognition, observing and building my Pacific Northwest image in travel, and even navigating queer social geography through Grindr. My penchant for exploring spatial narratives comes from these experiences.</p>
<p>After the Puget Sound, I moved back to Florida a half year before the pandemic and resettled in Gainesville. The larger region of North Central Florida is mostly rural and known for its springs and clear creek runs, rolling sandhills of the Brooksville and Trail Ridges, salt marshes of the Big Bend Coast, and more. In Gainesville, I've been active in civic participation and community organization, mostly food-related interventions like FGS and Farm 2 Neighbors, work with the Alachua County Labor Coalition on housing, and advocating for a transit network that prioritizes bicycle, pedestrian, and mass transit circulation. Now, after part-time studying GIS, I am moving on to complete a master's of urban planning at the University of Florida with a focus on transportation planning.</p>
<h2 id="on-planning">On planning</h2>
<p>My formative experiences with geography inform my ideology on cities and planning. Planning is power - although planning doesn't evoke the overt violence of a military or the iron hand of an authoritarian regime, architecture shapes one's experience in a space. Through form, certain things are made possible or facilitated, other things made impossible or at the very least hidden or more difficult. It's one thing to affect an act's possibility, but something much more insidious to design covertly - it gives the illusion of individual agency in mostly totalized landscapes.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious expressions of this power is the theme park, Walt Disney World, for example. Within its borders there is the illusion of free choice - markets, rides, designed experiences to navigate - facilitated by easy circulation with free mass transit, internal roadways, free parking, and pedestrian zones. Park-goers are enraptured by consumption - while they <em>could</em> imagine what isn't there, they <em>don't</em>.</p>
<p>Other manifestations of this type of power include the many types of private/public-private zones in the world - American suburban subdivisions, Manila megacomplexes, New Urbanist redevelopments, airports, private cities, the list goes on. Auto-oriented designs of regions, like my hometown, make human scale social connectivity difficult and encourage consumption in zones that give space to parking like shopping centers, stadiums, etc. Lack of transit, be it mass or auto, encourage stagnation much like a pond. There are as well features like porous borders (e.g. US-Mexico or Israel-Occupied Palestine) or institutions like hospitals or prisons that create subjects out of humans through their very design and collusion with systemized discourse like law and health.</p>
<p>Planning, as a power, is political and is one of the arms of capitalism. The built landscape is structured in the image of Capitalism's desire. As mobility, road networks and even mass transit to some extent facilitate the movement of people as consumers to places of consumption, of people as labor to their workplaces, of goods freely circulating. Segregation, formal, historical, or informal, allows the strongest consumers, in the US the white and upper middle class, to move freely while segregated areas circulate less freely, whether through worse roadways, fewer sidewalks, less transit, or higher police presence. Our housing system is largely based on how much profit a developer can get from their land speculation, and how much rent landlords can achieve from simply amassing enough capital. These create large sprawls of housing on cheap land with poor or no connection to cores - where there may be places to live, there are no places to go.</p>
<p>The form the city takes is not my object. What matters the most to me is whose desire planning reflects. Planning is like a technology - despite leading to its own discursive realms, planning is a neutral power. Who wields power is the most important thing to recognize, and right now planning and its means of production, along with its manifestations' means of production, are locked up in capitalists' desires. The equity we aim for, to privilege and meet the needs of Black, Indigenous, brown, and disabled folks, will not be possible until every mean is seized for us. What autonomy can we exert upon the city? What styles of city ownership encourages power shaped by community and not the mobility of money? How can we manifest our city without begging developers to make it happen?</p>
<p>Planning as a politics must be seized to see the city we want to see. Until then, we only are begging for concessions from Capital.</p>
