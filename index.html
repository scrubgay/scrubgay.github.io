<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I owe who I am to my geographies. My heritage traces to the Philippines's Central Luzon - from there comes my skin, tongue, and culture. I am rooted in Florida's Lake Wales Ridge, where hyperendemic scrub mints, the citrus collapse hinterland, and an odd Filipino enclave, all collide. My stints across the US - longest in Seattle and Gainesville (where I am now) - have taught me how to see the world through geography - of place, of flux, of conflict, and of course through endless critique.</p>
<p>What occupies me most is studying flows of capital. Currently I'm exploring the growth of the US single-family rental market as a function of crisis and increasingly institutionalized and financialized everyday landscapes. My most recent work, <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol26num1/article17.html">Who owns our homes</a> is the first of a series that explores data methods of mapping the growth of institutional (shadowy hedge fund managers and their capital - once in the board room but now <em>everywhere</em>) investment in housing.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in the role of crises - natural disaster, financial collapse, and the <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2018/04/field-notes/PHIL-NEEL-with-Paul-Mattick"><em>Long</em> Crisis</a> - in shaping capital's movement. I'm interested in the geography of rent and how rent slowly becomes the only frontier for overaccumulated capital.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to map this landscape's meaning for us. I see our horizons dwindling as it becomes harder and harder to live - because of a state that withdraws care and protection, because of capital's increasing empowerment over everything, and for a bleak climate future. (Because I can't draw pictures,) I hope that through data, research, and synthesizing narrative, I can create pictures - mappings - of the landscapes of conflict and flux we find ourselves in, and how capital and ecology shapes both. From this map, I hope to (help) create an agenda for the genesis of the world whose future shines for us.</p>
