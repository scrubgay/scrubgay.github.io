### *Upzoning is necessary, but won't produce an equitable Gainesville on its own*

  - Published on August 2nd, 2022
  - Response to City of Gainesville's consideration of elimination of single-family upzoning
  - Permalink: [Gainesville Sun](https://www.gainesville.com/story/opinion/2022/08/02/renz-torres-upzoning-alone-wont-produce-equity-gainesville/10175492002/)

  > Upzoning needs to happen, but inequitable effects need to be mitigated.  
  > Keeping Gainesville mostly single-family zoned will not work for anyone but the affluent in the long term, as housing prices and rent continue to increase and current housing dilapidates.
  > Upzoning must be combined with other devices to achieve an equitable city that protects owners and renters (eviction and foreclosure prevention, stronger tenant laws), produces permanently affordable housing (community land trusts, limited equity cooperatives, investment in public housing) and prevents gentrification (inclusive community master plans and Black/Brown collective ownership of blocks and neighborhoods).

### *A nationwide housing crisis hits locally*

  - Published in November 2021
  - Op-ed on local affordable housing issues with a spotlight on tenant discrimination with Section 8 and COVID-era ERAP

  > Who do we blame [for the housing crisis]?
  > We blame corporate landlords. We blame sprawling firms that have transformed the home into an asset and have taken the majority of the rental housing stock captive...
  > We blame our government. We blame a legal system that lacks affordable housing and adequate tenants rights protections as well as the teeth to proactively enforce the protections that do exist. We also blame our elected officials for not doing enough to combat these issues...
  > So what can we do to get out of this crisis? We have to assert our rights to housing, both for ourselves and for our communities...

### *Hey Gainesville! Enforce your housing discrimination ordinance!*

  - Published in November 2021
  - Op-ed on tenant discrimination related to the Emergency Rental Assistance Program
  - Permalink: [The Gainesville Iguana](https://gainesvilleiguana.org/2021/articles/hey-gainesville-enforce-your-housing-discrimination-ordinance/)

  > One major problem with Ordinance #190814 is the City‚Äôs lack of enforcement. For example, the Emergency Rental Assistance Program is structured so that the landlord has to consent to participating in the program. In other words, a landlord‚Äôs ‚Äúno‚Äù can mean someone is on the street. Even with the Ordinance‚Äôs precedent to make landlords accept ERAP, lease non-renewals continue to be served...

### *Geopolitics and the Search for Home*

  - Published in August 2018
  - Lyrical piece I wrote after a stay in the Olympia oil blockade and nationwide anti-ICE occupations
  - Permalink: [Slingshot Collective](https://slingshotcollective.org/geopolitics-and-the-search-for-home/)

  > Capitalism finds its power in the geopolitical. Capitalism needs land bases, property lines drawn and enforced by law and police ‚Äì it needs entire mountainsides of pines to destroy for the timber market, it needs a chemical-pumping factory to process its raw materials, it needs a warehouse from which to trade...
  > But just like capitalism, we and our radical movements find strength in the geopolitical, in the construction and fostering of defiantly autonomous spaces. We need spaces to grow our food, spaces to live and relax, spaces to congregate.
