### *Upzoning is necessary, but won't produce an equitable Gainesville on its own*

  - Published on August 2nd, 2022
  - Response to City of Gainesville's consideration of elimination of single-family upzoning

  > Upzoning needs to happen, but inequitable effects need to be mitigated.  
  > Keeping Gainesville mostly single-family zoned will not work for anyone but the affluent in the long term, as housing prices and rent continue to increase and current housing dilapidates. New development will be forced westward, encouraging poor regional land use, traffic and sprawl. We do need more housing, and we need it to stay within the city.
  > However, upzoning cannot operate unmitigated. Upzoning must be combined with other devices to achieve an equitable city that protects owners and renters (eviction and foreclosure prevention, stronger tenant laws), produces permanently affordable housing (community land trusts, limited equity cooperatives, investment in public housing) and prevents gentrification (inclusive community master plans and Black/Brown collective ownership of blocks and neighborhoods). Only then will we have a Gainesville with a place for everyone.

### *A nationwide housing crisis hits locally*

  - Published in November 2021

  > Who do we blame [for the housing crisis]?
  > We blame corporate landlords. We blame sprawling firms that have transformed the home into an asset and have taken the majority of the rental housing stock captive...
  > We blame our government. We blame a legal system that lacks affordable housing and adequate tenants rights protections as well as the teeth to proactively enforce the protections that do exist. We also blame our elected officials for not doing enough to combat these issues...
  > So what can we do to get out of this crisis? We have to assert our rights to housing, both for ourselves and for our communities...

### *Hey Gainesville! Enforce your housing discrimination ordinance!*

  - Published in November 2021
  - Op-ed on tenant discrimination related to the Emergency Rental Assistance Program

  > One major problem with Ordinance #190814 is the City’s lack of enforcement. For example, the Emergency Rental Assistance Program is structured so that the landlord has to consent to participating in the program. In other words, a landlord’s “no” can mean someone is on the street. Even with the Ordinance’s precedent to make landlords accept ERAP, lease non-renewals continue to be served...

### *Geopolitics and the Search for Home*

  > Capitalism finds its power in the geopolitical. Capitalism needs land bases, property lines drawn and enforced by law and police – it needs entire mountainsides of pines to destroy for the timber market, it needs a chemical-pumping factory to process its raw materials, it needs a warehouse from which to trade. Capitalism destroys even the common lands, eroding ecosystems and health worldwide with pesticides, industrial reagents, and sulfurous oxides. States need borders to manage the flux of bodies, so that security industries can profit off detention centers and border militarization, so that “illegal” immigrants work lower wages to earn their employer’s fingers-crossed promise of no-tell, so that the brown undesirables stay out of the country… the list doesn’t end.
  > But just like capitalism, we and our radical movements find strength in the geopolitical, in the construction and fostering of defiantly autonomous spaces. We need spaces to grow our food, spaces to live and relax, spaces to congregate. Yet as much as capitalism leads one to believe, land is not just a resource to be fashioned into structures: land forms the base of the resilient relationships and friendships implicated in the word “community”. Here too is the magic of occupations. In less noteworthy circumstances, the first blip of a relationship begins with conversations about the weather, traffic, and other local geographical particularities. As a kid, my few friendships blossomed because we shared not only neighborhoods, classrooms, and parks, but because we shared them over time. Now 20 and anxiety-ridden, it still comes relatively easily to converse with folk in the space of a blockade or occupation; it yet comes easy when we’re partaking in the same occupation, the same community potluck, the same garden. It’s no surprise that the etymology of the word “comrade” (according to Wiktionary) is the Latinate camarata, meaning room or chamber mate.
