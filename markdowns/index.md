## About Renz

Although originally born in New York City, Renz's home landscape is the war between the xeric scrub of the Lake Wales Ridge (of unknown Native territoriality) and the stroads, sprawl, and single-family housing of Central Floridian suburbia. Here Renz was witness to the decimation of exceedingly endemic plant populations and habitats for scrub jays and gopher tortoises, for a capitalist housing ecology that gives zero fucks about the people it houses or the land it destroys.

Now living in Gainesville, FL, Renz finds beauty in the diverse landscapes - springs, bluffs, sandhills, savannas, salt marshes - of North Florida.

Renz's approach to urbanity is not motivated by the form of cities, but of the preservation of processes. Cities at a minimum must have their forms designed for the scale of human mobilities, and they must be tightly bound to prevent encroachment onto the little natural/managed lands that are left. However, a walkable/smart growth/New Urbanist/[*buzzword*] city means nothing if it excludes or limits Black, Indigenous, Brown, or disabled autonomy. The best City is the one where residents are not reduced to a biopolitical subject managed by Capital. This can look like

  - a housing means of production owned by the people it houses
  - a local food system owned by the people that grow and the people that eat
  - neighborhoods and transportation networks designed for human, not car, scales of mobility, designed for any mobility

The best City is the one where Capital does not live and does not accumulate in the hands of few.

Renz wants an anti-capitalist world. Renz wants the language and tools of endless extraction dead. Renz wants autonomy of process for their communities. The local forms of these worlds, on principle, will differ community to community - just so long as the processes enabling capitalism and colonization are ended.
