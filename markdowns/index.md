# Welcome!

I'm Renz and I use they/them pronouns. Here's what I'm doing as of Spring 2025:

- researching affordable housing with the University of Florida [Shimberg Center for Housing Studies](https://shimberg.ufl.edu) 👾
- graduating from a master's program at the University of Florida's [Urban and Regional Planning](https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp) program 🐊
- walking, writing, musicking, botanizing 🚶🏽‍♂️🌻✍🏽

## Where I come from

I am my geographies. My blood, skin, tongue, and in part culture, are Filipino. I'm rooted amidst the scrub mints and suburban hinterlands of the Lake Wales Ridge. My stints across the US - the clayey Rust Belt flats of Lake Erie, the Douglas-fir lowlands of Seattle, and the karsty bluffs and ravines of North Florida - have dialed in an intense fixation on place, geography, heterogeneity, and capital movements. 

I study movements of global finance through housing in the United States. My topics of late have included concentration and monopoly in single-family rental spaces and corporate erosion of homeownership, disaster recovery and property ownership, eviction geography, and investment vis-à-vis climate change, risk, and collapse. Big data analysis is my M.O. - my most recent work, [Who owns our homes](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol26num1/article17.html), outlines a method to explore concentration of ownership using parcel data.

My positive project with my research is mapping. Capital has reterritorialized every aspect of being within itself, and all our productive existence is mediated through it. I hope that by mapping, through data, theory, and narrative, I create pictures of the landscapes of conflict we find ourselves in. Using the map, I hope that we can find our way out of capital's totality into our own world.
