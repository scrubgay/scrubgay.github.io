                        <p>I am one of the main coordinators and primary founders/"extenders" of <a href="https://facebook.com/gnvfgs">Free Grocery Store</a>. We are a mutual aid operation that delivers free food biweekly to over 350 people across over 120 households experiencing food insecurity.</p>
                        <p>Free Grocery Store began as a small food diversion project hosted by the <a href="https://civicmediacenter.org">Civic Media Center</a> that served 20 to 30 people. At the onset of the COVID pandemic in March 2020, I created a logistics that combined sourcing food from the local food bank, diversion from allied grocery stores and point sources, donation streams, a client and volunteer database schema, outreach materials, and volunteer labor for packing and delivering groceries.</p>
                        <p>The roles I currently fill in Free Grocery Store are: managing client relations and communications, oversight of our non-profit incorporation process, special projects such as expansion of our mobile distribution program, and management of our client and volunteer database. I am currently building out a web-based interface and associated PHP and PostgreSQL back-end for working with our database.</p>

                        <p>I am also an organizer and volunteer of <a href="https://instagram.com/farm2n">Farm 2 Neighbors</a>. Farm 2 Neighbors is a food redistribution program with a hyper-local scope of the Kincaid Loop, a number of neighborhoods off Alachua County Road 2043, otherwise SE 15th St, SE 42nd Ave, and SE 27th St.</p>

                        <p>Farm 2 Neighbors was originally the idea of a Gainesville woman, Tuesday. At the beginning of the 2020 COVID pandemic, large food supply excesses were created due to social distancing guidelines and lockdowns, include surpluses from local farms in Gainesville. Tuesday wanted to distribute the excess from local organic farms <a href="https://siembrafarm.com/">Siembra Farm</a> and <a href="https://www.thefamilygardencsa.com/">The Family Garden</a> to local neighbors. Eventually, Tuesday left Gainesville and another Gainesville woman, Brackin, took over the project with the help of volunteer organizers.</p>
                        <p>Beneath the surface of a simple food redistribution, Farm 2 Neighbors attempts to address the racial politics of the Kincaid Loop. As a whole, the Loop is racially mixed. However, upper middle class white people occupy large tracts of acreage within the loop, particularly within the center in the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220506153628/https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/environment/2016/10/01/neighbors-pull-together-to-restore-sandhill-landscape/25277547007/">"Flamingo Hammock"</a>, whereas Black families and low-income white families tend to occupy 1970s suburban boom neighborhoods. The organic farms that occupy the center of the loop are white-owned as well, operating within the framework of black neighborhoods.</p>
                        <p>Farm 2 Neighbors is a way of connecting neighborhoods of the Loop using food as the unifier. Food, in this case, is one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220427232143/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">reparation</a> for a still-existing racialized inequality of land ownership (big sprawling manors and plantations versus small quarters) represented in the Kincaid Loop.</p>
                        <p>Farm 2 Neighbors originally operated off of the excesses produced by the farm, but as of 2022 we are trying to stabilize the effort in the long term by ensuring that some produce grown by the farms is grown specifically for the neighborhood.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At my <small>brief</small> time working at the <a href="https://laborcoalition.org">Alachua County Labor Coalition</a>, I began work on researching neighborhoods and apartment complexes impacted by housing instability - evictions and foreclosures - in Gainesville and Alachua County, with the goal of doing targeted outreach in those areas. The project was much deeper than expected, so even as I left the ACLC, I continued with researching evictions in my URP 6272 class.</p>
                        <p>Using a Javascript web scraper written by a Gainesville local, I mined 20 years of eviction data from the Alachua Clerk of Court website. Using R, the <a href="https://slu-opengis.github.io/postmastr/">postmastr</a> and <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> libraries, and a public E911 table for Alachua County, I normalized and geocoded 90% of the 34,000 cases.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>I produced a geographically weighted regression model (R-squared = 0.73) on log-transformed eviction counts. It predicts that evictions in an area are positively correlated with higher Hispanic/Latino and Black proportions, and negatively correlated with increased single-family detached housing and proportion of people with income below the poverty level. Higher weight is given to the proportion of Hispanic/Latinos and Black people in a census block group. It predicts as well a south-north increasing impact of Hispanic/Latino proportions and an east-west increasing spatial impact of Black proportions.</p>

                        <p>This is an extension of the <a href="#ac-food-desert">Alachua County Food Desert project</a> that maps the relative locations and densities of supermarkets versus convenience stores and other access points that don't sell fresh fruits and vegetables. This is mapped as a quotient of network distance to nearest convenience store (or similar) over network distance to nearest supermarket. The quotient is relative, rather than absolute - it is compared to the entire dataset.</p>

                        <p>This is a short project that maps out the location of food deserts in Alachua County at the rural scale, and in Gainesville at the local scale. This is a short project I undertook at the beginning of the pandemic to better understand areas Free Grocery Store would be working in, as well as a way of mapping what conventional food access points exist in the County and surrounding areas. Distances were mapped using network distances on roads, not Euclidean "crow's" distance.</p>
